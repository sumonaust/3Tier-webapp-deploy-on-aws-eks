# 3Tier-webapp-deploy-on-aws-eks
<br>Description:<br/>
This project is a hands-on walk through of a three-tier web application deploy in AWS. We will be manually creating the necessary backend, frontend and database connection each other by configmap and secret. We will seee Backend and frontend integration and how we can make connection those three things. 

<b>Deployment:</br>
The deployment process involves setting up AWS resources, containerizing the application components using Docker, and running them on AWS infrastructure. See [AWS Three Tier Web Architecture](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/85cd2bb2-7f79-4e96-bdee-8078e469752a/en-US)

<b>Integration:</br>
To ensure seamless communication between the backend and frontend, you'll need to perform the integration tasks. This involves connecting API endpoints, handling data exchange, and synchronizing frontend interactions with the backend.
